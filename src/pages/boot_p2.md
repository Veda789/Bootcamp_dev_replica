#### THE INSTRUCTOR
## Meet the instructor

Hello, I am Flavio Copes. You may know me from my blog flaviocopes.com , my free programming ebooks on thevalleyofcode.com, or my freeCodeCamp contributions. I have been organizing this Bootcamp every year since 2020. I am 39 years old, Italian. I graduated in computer engineering from Politecnico di Milano in 2008. My passion for computers dates back to the 1980s. I have been a Linux fan since 1998, a Mac enthusiast since 2005, bought my first JavaScript book in 1998, and consider myself a professional JavaScript developer since 2012.

Just a few words to let you know I'm serious about these things.

My mission is to help you become a Web Developer.
